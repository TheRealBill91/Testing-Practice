# Testing Practice

## About

This repository contains a JavaScript testing practice project, which focuses on writing tests for various functions and making those tests pass. The project covers multiple scenarios, such as string manipulation, calculator operations, the Caesar cipher, and array analysis. The main purpose of this project is to get comfortable with testing in JavaScript using Jest.

## What I learned

- Writing tests using Jest for various functions and scenarios
- Making tests pass by implementing the corresponding functions
- Using ES6 import statements with Jest and configuring Babel
- Implementing a capitalize function that capitalizes the first character of a string
- Implementing a reverseString function that reverses a given string
- Creating a calculator object with basic operations: add, subtract, divide, and multiply
- Implementing a caesarCipher function that shifts characters by a given factor, considering wrapping, case, and punctuation
- Implementing an analyzeArray function that takes an array of numbers and returns an object with average, min, max, and length properties
